    <h2>Program Benefits</h2>
    <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>Track exercise irrespective of activity (cycling, lifting weights, cleaning, gardening, sleeping, having a desk job, etc.)</li>
        <li>Users do NOT need to eliminate their favorite foods entirely. Nor do they have to reduce caloric intake.</li>
        <li>Breathe actually learns about users over time, offering a custom weight loss program that is specifically tuned to the individual.</li>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

      <p>That <strong>the dominant form of mass loss is carbon-dioxide (CO2) exhalation.</strong> Yes, it’s true. CO2 is the primary by-product of the fat dissociation process. When someone loses weight, approximately 84% of the mass physically exits their body through their breathe (hence the name of our program).</p>

      <p>It turns out that this approach misinterprets the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) by neglecting the <strong>TYPE</strong> of food being eaten. [Reference to Taubes 2007, “Good Calories, Bad Calories.”]. Counting calories neglects: glycation, hormones, epigenetics, contaminants, and many other effects---basically all the things you learned in chemistry class.</p>

      <h2>Addressing The Obesity Epidemic</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The obesity epidemic has systematically begun to erode the financial stability of the American health-care system. More than two-thirds of adults are overweight, and at least one-third are considered obese (5% are morbidly obese). Obesity is linked to the increasing incidence of heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cancer and other afflictions [REFERENCES HERE.]</p>

      <p>The saying “you are what you eat” does not quite capture the full extent of the impact that poor nutrition can have on a family and their lineage. Food is not only used by the body for nourishment but it also influences the expression of genes that are passed down hereditary lines. Research in epigenetics shows that what we eat governs the health of our children and grandchildren. Rather than just calories, food is interpreted by our body as a form of “information” that conveys vital clues regarding our environment.</p>
